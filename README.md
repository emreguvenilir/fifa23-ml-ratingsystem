# Mimicking the FIFA Soccer Player Rating System

This repository contains an ML project aimed at predicting player ratings based on FIFA 23 player data. The primary objective is to develop a model that can approximate FIFA's player rating system based on various player attributes and performance metrics.

### Important Dates:
 - **Data exploration presentation:** Thursday, April 25 in class
 - **Project Deadline:** May 8 

### Repo Contents:
 - **doc:** Detailed project description
 - **data:** Data and data documentation
 - **src:** Anything code related including: Data processing files, Linear and Polynomial Regression Models File, Random Forest Regressor Model File.

 ### Statement on the use of AI:
 Language Model Usage:

1. Error Message Resolution: ChatGPT was used to interpret error messages and produce debugging strategies
2. Python Function Analysis: Used to verify the correct usage of built in python functions
3. Syntax Checking: Used to produce examples to verify correct syntax within built in python functions and basic syntax corrections
4. Model Description Verification: Used ChatGPT to verify correct explanation of classification algorithms
5. ChatGPT was used to assist in the R code and using an unfamiliar library
